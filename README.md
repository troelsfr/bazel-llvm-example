# Svadilfari - LLVM builder for Python and C++

The aim of this project is to provide a framework for rapid LLVM prototyping. The project is named Sva√∞ilfari after the stallion that made it possible to build a wall around Asgard in just one winter. The project is written in C++ and is based on LLVM, Pybind11 and Python.

## Prerequisite

Install bazel version 3.5.0. Bazel is available on Windows via [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bazel) and Windows instructions can be found [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install-windows.html). All other dependencies are automatically downloaded and built by Bazel as part of the compilation process.

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to enable rapid prototyping for LLVM frontends and runtime using either the Python or C++ interface.
By constructing a framework for rapid prototyping the barrier to construct experiments with LLVM is substantially lowered.
In a nutshell, any prototype consists of a runtime, a compiler, a script optimiser and a VM to execute the code.

### Defining a runtime

In Python you can define a runtime as:

```python
rt = Runtime()
rt.define_type(PrimitiveTypes.Int64, "Int64")
rt.define_type(PrimitiveTypes.Void, "Unit")
rt.declare_function("__quantum__qis__cnot__body", "Int8", ["Int8"])
```

Currently the Python API does not allow to attach the runtime implementation whereas the C++ interface does:

```c++
  Runtime rt;
  rt.defineType<int64_t>("Int64");
  runtime.defineType<void>("Unit");

  // Declaring and defining a function
  runtime.defineFunction("print",
                         [](int64_t x) -> void { std::cout << "Value: " << x << "\n"; });

  // Only declaring
  runtime.declareFunction<void, double>("printDouble");
```

When defining a function, the runtime will make it available directly in VM without further implementation needed.

### Creating a script

This framework provides a lot of tools to allow the developer to create executable LLVM scripts.

```python
program = ScriptBuilder(rt)
test_builder = program.new_function("Test", "Unit", [])
x = test_builder.to_int64(127)
hello = test_builder.new_stack_variable(i64, "hello")
hello.set(x)
test_builder.return_value(x.get())
```

The Python API for building scripts is still experimental and will likely undergo heavy changes.

### Running the VM

Once a program was created, we can test the script together with the runtime using the built-in VM:

```
vm = VM(rt)
script = program.make_script()
vm.execute(script, "Test")
```

## How to run the example

Run

```
bazel run //svadilfari/python:example
```

to build all dependencies of `svadilfari/python/example.py` and run the executable. This commands builds a Rust library for logging, a C++ module (that uses the Rust library) which depends on LLVM to make a QIR builder and the C++ library is exported as a Python library. This Python library is imported in the python executable where it is used to build a QIR. A full build (including building required LLVM modules from scratch) is around 13 minutes. An example build output is here:

```
% bazel run //svadilfari/python:example
Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...

}

declare %Qubit @__quantum__qis__qubit_create()

declare %Qubit @__quantum__qis__x__body(%Qubit)

declare %Qubit @__quantum__qis__z__body(%Qubit)

declare %Qubit @__quantum__qis__cnot__body(%Qubit, %Qubit)

```

Other targets include:

```
bazel run //svadilfari/rust/apps/hello-world:hello-world
```

To run all tests:

```
bazel test //...
```

Build all C++ targets:

```
bazel build //svadilfari/cc/...
```

Test all C++ targets

```
bazel test //svadilfari/cc/...
```

Build all Rust targets:

```
bazel build //svadilfari/rust/...
```

Build C# `hello-world.exe`:

```
bazel run --host_platform @io_bazel_rules_dotnet//dotnet/toolchain:darwin_amd64_5.0.201 --platforms @io_bazel_rules_dotnet//dotnet/toolchain:darwin_amd64_5.0.201 //svadilfari/csharp:hello-world.exe
```

Note that for C# we specify the host and target platforms. These settings can be put into the `.bazelrc.user` to avoid retyping in which case the run command reduces to

```
bazel run //svadilfari/csharp:hello-world.exe
```

Clean up:

```
bazel clean
bazel shutdown
```

## Rust example

While not coupled to other frameworks, you can also run the rust example:

```
bazel run
```

## Testing

To run all tests, type

```
bazel //...
```
