# Svadilfari - LLVM builder for Python

The aim of this project is to provide a framework for rapid LLVM prototyping. The project is named Sva√∞ilfari after the stallion that made it possible to build a wall around Asgard in just one winter. The project is written in C++ and is based on LLVM, Pybind11 and Python.

## Prerequisite

Install bazel version 3.5.0. Bazel is available on Windows via [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bazel) and Windows instructions can be found [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install-windows.html). However, this is untested.

## How to run the example

Run

```
bazel run //svadilfari/python:example
```

to build all dependencies of `svadilfari/python/example.py` and run the executable. This commands builds a Rust library for logging, a C++ module (that uses the Rust library) which depends on LLVM to make a QIR builder and the C++ library is exported as a Python library. This Python library is imported in the python executable where it is used to build a QIR. A full build (including building required LLVM modules from scratch) is around 13 minutes. An example build output is here:

```
% bazel run //svadilfari/python:example

declare %Qubit @__quantum__qis__cnot__body(%Qubit, %Qubit)

```

Other targets include:

```
bazel run //svadilfari/rust/apps/hello-world:hello-world
```

To run all tests:

```
bazel test //...
```

Build all C++ targets:

```
bazel build //svadilfari/cc/...
```

Test all C++ targets

```
bazel test //svadilfari/cc/...
```

Build all Rust targets:

```
bazel build //svadilfari/rust/...
```

Build C# `hello-world.exe`:

```
bazel run --host_platform @io_bazel_rules_dotnet//dotnet/toolchain:darwin_amd64_5.0.201 --platforms @io_bazel_rules_dotnet//dotnet/toolchain:darwin_amd64_5.0.201 //svadilfari/csharp:hello-world.exe
```

Note that for C# we specify the host and target platforms. These settings can be put into the `.bazelrc.user` to avoid retyping in which case the run command reduces to

```
bazel run //svadilfari/csharp:hello-world.exe
```

Clean up:

```
bazel clean
bazel shutdown
```

## Rust example

While not coupled to other frameworks, you can also run the rust example:

```
bazel run
```

## Testing

To run all tests, type

```
bazel //...
```
